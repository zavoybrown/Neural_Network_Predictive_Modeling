> For project four, we are focusing on predictive maintenance for renewable energy systems. This project addresses critical challenges in the industry, the longevity of cutting-edge technology, and aims to contribute to a sustainable future. Our goal is to combine the practical benefits of cost savings and efficiency with the broader goal of supporting global renewable energy initiatives. This project was completed with the support of Peers, Stack Overflow, Google, AI, and Activities. 

Our research aims to address these key questions:

1. How can predictive maintenance contribute to renewable energy systems sustainability?

2. What trends can be identified in the cost production of turbine installation from historical data?

3. What is the optimal strategy for using classification models to identify failure points?

# Electricity Cost Analysis

According to the United States Energy Information Administration, the average U.S. home purchases 899 kWh of energy per month.

The United States Geological Survey states that a wind turbine with a 42% capacity factor (the average among recently built wind turbines since 2021), generates over 843,000 kWh of electricity per month. 

This means that one wind turbine that came online in 2020 generates enough electricity to power 937 US homes a month.


$\text{Number of homes powered per month} = \frac{{843,000kWh}}{{899 kWh/home}}=937.71 \text{ homes}$



it takes this wind turbine 46.8 minutes to power 1 US home.



$\text{Time to power one home for one month} = \frac{{1 \text{ home}}}{{937.71 \text{ homes/month}}}=0.001066 \text{ months}$



Currently, wind turbines experience around 23 hours of downtime per month, the equivalent of roughly 30 homes per month. With our predictive modeling in place to identify up to 75% of failures, this downtime could be cut to roughly six hours per month. Thats enough to power 22 homes per month **per wind turbine using our predictive maintenance model!**

### Analysis
1. **Predictive Maintenance**: Our analysis shows neural networks can signifcantly improve cost efficiency through predictive maintenance. Neural network are essential for Wind Turbine renewable energy systems and can a increase reliability, lower maintenance costs, and improved sustainability, contributing to a more efficient energy supply.

2. **Cost Trends**: Analyzing wind turbine cost breakdowns highlights the production complexity and the importance of effective maintainance. Technological advancements, government policies, lower material costs, and improved practices have driven down production costs globally from 2010 to 2022. 

3. **Strategy**: Utilizing a model to identify non-operational turbine data from historical datasets allows us to detect trends in faulty equipment. This empowers us to make preemptive decisions, such as dispatching maintenance workers and consulting engineers to troubleshoot potential issues, minimizing repair and breakdown costs.

## Summary 
In summary, our predictive model can significantly enhance wind turbine energy production by reducing maintenance and repair costs, decreasing downtime, and increasing production and revenue. Additionally, minimizing downtime lessens the reliance on fossil fuels to compensate for turbine outages.
